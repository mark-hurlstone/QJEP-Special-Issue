## Special Issue call:  
The multicomponent model of working memory proposed by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch nearly five decades ago is one of the oldest and most influential models in cognitive psychology. In their seminal paper, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) set out a framework for understanding immediate memory processes that replaced the older concept of a unitary short-term memory store with a working memory. Specifically, they proposed a system combining domain-specific storage components (the articulatory loop and visuo-spatial scratch-pad) with a limited capacity central processor (the central executive) and they outlined key dimensions of the relationship between these components and cognition. Although the specific details of the model have evolved since then, its broad structure remains fundamentally unchanged, except for the addition of a fourth domain-general storage component (the episodic buffer; Baddeley, 2000). The model has enjoyed tremendous success in this time, stimulating experimental, developmental, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging research on its structure, and computational modelling to formally define the function of some of its components. It has also been productively applied across a wide range of practical contexts including vocabulary acquisition, developmental disorders, reading, arithmetic, language comprehension, and neuropsychological disorders to name but a few areas of application. 

Although the Baddeley and Hitch (1974) model was introduced in a volume of *The Psychology of Learning and Motivation*, less well known is that some of the key empirical evidence was later laid out in more detail in a paper published in the *Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology* (QJEP) by Hitch and Baddeley (1976). It is therefore appropriate and fitting for a special issue of QJEP to celebrate 50 years of the Baddeley and Hitch working memory tradition. We invite submissions of papers that provide contemporary insights and analysis for the working memory model, showcasing state-of-the-art work in this area. 

One key objective of this special issue is to assemble a range of papers that reflect the broad scope of empirical, applied, computational, developmental, and theoretical work relevant to contemporary working memory research in the Baddeley and Hitch tradition. Another key objective is to incorporate the constructive, diverse character of the working memory community that welcomes contributions, whether from new or experienced researchers, whether supportive or critical of particular ideas of the multicomponent model. To foster such balance, the timeline includes an expression of interest phase that will help to manage the balance of potential work. 

## Proposed Timeline:  
*	[Letter of intent](Letter of Intent.docx)<sup>*</sup>deadline: <span style="color: black">**15 September 2023**</span> 
*	Submission deadline of recommended manuscripts: <span style="color: black">**31 January 2024**</span>

*	Deadline for accepting manuscripts: <span style="color: black">**1 August 2024**</span> 
  
\* The letter of intent will be used to make preliminary decisions about recommending submissions for a full-scale review based on special issue balance, viability of research etc. 
  
Authors wishing to propose Registered Reports are strongly encouraged to make early submissions to make the overall timeline feasible. Potential authors are welcome to contact the editorial team to discuss the special issue.
